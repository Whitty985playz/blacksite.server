# READ THIS BEFORE LOOKING THROUGH THIS REPO!

If you are following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/Ez8F0nW6S-w), do not make any pull requests for this repository, or **ANY** repository you do not own/contribute to.

There is a problem going around on GitHub because of that tutorial, where multiple pull requests are being opened for repositories and have to be denied.

Please read the pinned comment of that video, the issue was addressed but, to be afair no one watching a tutorial even reads the comments any way.

**If you would like to test out the pull request, do it on your own repository.**
